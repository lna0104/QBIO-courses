"National_Park_Data.csv"
Data compiled by QLD NPS from desktop analyses and previous amphibian and plant surveys.

NP = Code for each of the 15 National Parks (NPs) sampled (parks names have been de-identified as they are confidential)

VPD = Mean annual Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD; how dry the atmosphere is; higher is drier) for each NP. There is only one value per NP (average across each entire park)

NP_area_1000_ha = the area of the NP (in thousands of hectares)

visit_rate_1000_per_yr = Average number of visitors per year in thousands

frog_spp_richness = Number of amphibian species recorded in each NP during surveys conducted between 2010 and 2020

plant_spp_richness = Number of plant species recorded in each NP during suverys conducted between 2010 and 2020



"Chytrid_Amphibian_Data.csv"
Data collected by QLD NPS in summer 2021 across 15 national parks.

NP = Code for each of the 15 National Parks (NPs) sampled (parks names have been de-identified as they are confidential)

creek_id = the ID number for each creek sampled for frogs and toads in each NP. A total of five creeks were sampled per NP

track_density = The density of walking tracks within a 500m radius of each creek sampling site

pop_density = The estimated density of the frog/toad population in each sampled creek

species â€“ The species of frog or toad. These are Taudactylus acutirostris, Rhinella marina and Taudactylus rheophilus.

n_frogs_sampled = the number of frogs of each species sampled in each creek (this number varies)

n_infected = The number of sampled frogs/toads that had visible signs of Chytrid infection
